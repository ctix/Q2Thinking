# Compiling `thesis.tex` to PDF

This guide explains how to compile the `thesis.tex` file into a PDF document on your local system.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need a working LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. Common distributions include:

*   **TeX Live:** Recommended for Linux and Windows. Also available for macOS (often via MacTeX).
*   **MiKTeX:** Common for Windows, also available for Linux and macOS.
*   **MacTeX:** A distribution based on TeX Live, specifically for macOS.

Ensure that your LaTeX distribution includes `pdflatex` and `bibtex`. These are standard components.

You will also need the thesis files:
*   `thesis.tex`
*   `references.bib` (even if empty or just with placeholders, it's needed by the compilation process)
*   `compile_thesis.sh` (the provided helper script)
*   Any image files if you have added figures to `thesis.tex`.

## 2. Using the `compile_thesis.sh` Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to compile the thesis is to use the provided shell script.

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory** where you have saved `thesis.tex`, `references.bib`, and `compile_thesis.sh`.
3.  **Make the script executable (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    chmod +x compile_thesis.sh
    ```
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./compile_thesis.sh
    ```

The script will run the necessary sequence of `pdflatex` and `bibtex` commands. If successful, you will find `thesis.pdf` in the same directory. Check the output messages from the script for any errors or warnings. The main log file generated by LaTeX is `thesis.log`.

## 3. Manual Compilation Steps

If you prefer to run the commands manually or need to troubleshoot, here is the typical sequence:

1.  **Initial `pdflatex` run:**
    ```bash
    pdflatex thesis.tex
    ```
    This generates auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.toc`, etc.).

2.  **`bibtex` run:**
    ```bash
    bibtex thesis.aux
    ```
    This processes your `references.bib` file based on citations found in the `.aux` file and creates a `.bbl` file. (Note: the argument is `thesis.aux`, not `thesis.tex` or `thesis.bib`).

3.  **Second `pdflatex` run:**
    ```bash
    pdflatex thesis.tex
    ```
    This incorporates the bibliography from the `.bbl` file and updates the table of contents, list of figures, etc.

4.  **Third `pdflatex` run:**
    ```bash
    pdflatex thesis.tex
    ```
    This ensures all cross-references (citations, figure numbers, page numbers in ToC) are correctly resolved.

After these steps, `thesis.pdf` should be fully generated.

## 4. Basic Troubleshooting

*   **Command not found (`pdflatex`, `bibtex`):** Your LaTeX distribution is likely not installed correctly or not in your system's PATH. Reinstall or check your distribution's documentation.
*   **Missing `.sty` file (e.g., `times.sty not found`):** You may need to install additional packages for your LaTeX distribution. Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `tlmgr` for TeX Live, MiKTeX Console for MiKTeX).
*   **Errors in `thesis.log`:** The `thesis.log` file contains detailed information about the compilation process. Search for lines starting with `!` (error) or `Warning:` to identify issues. Common errors include undefined citations, missing image files, or LaTeX syntax mistakes.
*   **Bibliography not appearing or citations as [?]:**
    *   Ensure `references.bib` exists and is correctly formatted.
    *   Make sure you ran `bibtex thesis.aux` successfully (check `thesis.blg` for BibTeX errors).
    *   Ensure you ran `pdflatex` enough times after `bibtex`.
*   **Using `biber` with `biblatex`:** If you modify `thesis.tex` to use `biblatex` instead of traditional BibTeX (e.g., by uncommenting `\\usepackage{biblatex}` in the preamble and setting a backend like `biber`), the `bibtex thesis.aux` command should be replaced with `biber thesis`. The `compile_thesis.sh` script would also need to be updated accordingly.

Good luck with compiling your thesis!
